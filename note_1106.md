# Problems
1. 想請問老師，linux X86_64會不會發生如同以下連結提到的Win X86_64的算數陷阱: 
http://213style.blogspot.com/2016/01/win64-ab-b.html
	* 或許會有，不過需要更進一步的測試（處理器架構問題）
2. 請問老師可以再解釋一次can be caught是什麼意思嗎
3. 如果parent執行wait4()而child還在run的話是不是什麼都不會發生？就只是parent在等待而已?
	* 根據parent狀況來決定

## Thread Groups
* __**POSIX**-compliant multithreaded applications__ are best handled by kernels 
that support "***thread groups***."

* In Linux a ***thread group*** is basically a set of lightweight processes that
	* implement a multithreaded application
	* act as a whole with regards to some system calls 

## Why a Process Descriptor Is Introduced?
* To manage processes, the kernel must have a clear picture of what each process is doing.

## Brief Description of a Process Descriptor
* As the repository of so much information, 
the process descriptor is rather complex.
* In addition to a large number of fields containing process attributes, 
the process descriptor contains several pointers to other data structures that, in turn, 
contain pointers to other structures.

## Process State
* As its name implies, 
the **state** field of the process descriptor describes what is currently happening to the process.
* It consists of an ***array of flags***, 
each of which describes a possible ***process state***. 

## Fatal Signals
* A signal is fatal for a given process if delivering the signal causes the kernel to kill the process.
* The **SIGKILL** signal is always fatal.
* Each signal whose default action is “Terminate” and which is not caught by a process is also fatal for that process.
* Notice, however, that a signal caught by a process and whose corresponding *signal-handler function** terminates the process is NOT fatal

## Process State Transition

## Set the **state** Field of a Process
* The value of the **state** field is usually set with a simple assignment.
* The kernel also uses the **_set_task_state** and **_set_current_state** macros
	* they set
		* the state of a specified process
		* the state of the process currently executed
	* respectively

## Execution Context and Process Descriptor
* As a general rule, 
each ***execution context*** that can be independently scheduled must have its own ***process descriptor***.
* Therefore, even lightweight processes, 
which share a large portion of their kernel data structures, 
have their own **task_struct** structures.

## Identifying a Process
* The strict one-to-one correspondence between the __process__ and __process descriptor__
makes the 32-bit address of the **task_struct** structure a useful means for the kernel to identify processes.
* These addresses are referred to as ***process descriptor pointers***. 
* Most of the references to processes that the kernel makes are through process descriptor pointers.

## Lifetime and Storage Location of Process Descriptors
* Processes are dynamic entities whose lifetimes range from a few milliseconds to months.
	* Thus, the kernel must be able to handle many processes at the same time
* Process descriptors are stored in ***dynamic memory*** rather than in the memory area permanently assigned to the kernel.

## **thread_info**, Kernel Mode Stack, and Process Descriptor
* For each process, Linux packs two different data structures in a single  per-process memory area:
	1. a small data structure linked to the ***process descriptor***, namely the **thread_info** structure
	2. the ***Kernel Mode process stack***

## Length of Kernel Mode Stack and Structure **thread_info**
* The length of the structure **thread_info**
and kernel mode stack memory area of a process is **8,192** bytes (two page frames) after Linux 2.6.37.
* For reasons of efficiency the kernel stores the 8-KB memory area 
in two consecutive page frames with the first page frame aligned to a multiple of 2^13.

## Kernel Mode Stack
* A process in **Kernel Mode** accesses a **stack** contained in the ***kernel data segment***, 
which is different from the stack used by the process in **User Mode**.
* Because ***kernel control paths*** make little use of the stack, 
only a few thousand bytes of ***kernel stack*** are required. 
	* Therefore, 8 KB is ample space for the stack and the **thread_info** structure.

## Process Descriptor And Process Kernel Mode Stack

## esp Register
* The esp register is the CPU ***stack pointer***, which is used to address the stack's top location.
* On 80x86 systems, the stack starts at the end and grows toward the beginning of the memory area.
* Right after switching from **User Mode** to **Kernel Mode**, 
the kernel stack of a process is always empty,
	* and therefore the esp register points to the byte immediately following the stack.
* The value of the esp is decreased as soon as data is written into the stack.
* Because the **thread_info** structure is 52 bytes long, the kernel stack can expand up to 8,140 bytes.

## Macro **Current**
before  Linux 2.6.22
## Identifying the **current** Process
* The close association between the **thread_info** structure and the **Kernel Mode** stack offers a key benefit in terms of efficiency:
	* the kernel can easily obtain the address of the **thread_info** structure of the process currently running on a CPU from the value of the esp register.
* In fact, if the **thread_union** structure is **8 KB** (2^13 bytes) long, 
the kernel masks out the 13 least significant bits of esp to obtain the base address of the **thread_info** structure.
* On the other hand, if the **thread_union** structure is 4 KB long, the kernel masks out the 12 least significant bits of esp.

## Function **current_thread_info( )**
* This is done by the **current_thread_info( )** function
* After executing these three instructions, 
**p** contains the **thread_info** structure pointer of the process running on the CPU that executes the instruction.

## Macro **Current**
**after and including** Linux 2.6.22
## **current** : the **task_struct** Address of Current Process
* Linux stores the **task_struct** address of current process in the per-CPU variable **current_task**.
