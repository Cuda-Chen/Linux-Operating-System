## Segmentation in x86-64

## GDTR of x86-64
* The GDTR register holds the base address (64 bits in IA-32e mode) and the 16-bit table limit for the **GDT**

## LDTR of x86-64
* The LDTR register holds
	* the 16-bit segment selector
	* base address (64 bits in IA-32e mode)
	* segment limit
	* descriptor attributes for the **LDT**

## Segmentation in Compatibility Mode
* In **compatibility mode**, segmentation functions just as it does using legacy 16-bit or 32-bit protected mode semantics.

## Segmentation in 64-bit Mode (1)
* In 64-bit mode, segmentation is generally (but not completely) disabled, creating a flat 64-bit linear-address space. 
* The processor treats the segment base of **CS, DS, ES, SS** as zero, creating a linear address that is equal to the effective address.

## Segmentation in 64-bit Mode (2)
* The **FS** and **GS** segments are exceptions. 
* These segment registers (which hold the segment base) can be used as an additional base registers in linear address calculations. 
Note that the processor **does not** perform segment limit checks at runtime in 64-bit mode.

## Logical Address Translation
* In IA-32e mode, an Intel 64 processor uses the steps described in x32 architecture to translate a logical address to a linear address. 
* In 64-bit mode, the **offset** and **base address** of the segment are 64-bits instead of 32 bits. 

## Linear Address
* The linear address format is also 64 bits wide and is subject to the canonical form requirement.

## Segment Registers ES, DS, SS (1)
* ES, DS, and SS segment registers are not used in 64-bit mode
	* Therefore, their fields (base, limit, and attribute) in **segment descriptor registers** are ignored. 

## Segment Registers ES, DS, SS (2)
* Some forms of segment load instructions are also invalid (for example, **LDS, POP ES**). 
* Address calculations that reference the ES, DS, or SS segments are treated as if the segment base is zero.

## Code Segment Descriptor and Selectors
* *Code segment descriptors* and *selectors* are needed in IA-32e mode to establish the processor’s *operating mode* and *execution privilege-level*.
* In IA-32e mode, the **CS** descriptor’s **DPL** is used for execution privilege checks (as in legacy 32-bit mode).

## Code Segment Descriptor
* *Code segments* continue to exist in 64-bit mode even though, for address calculations, the segment base is treated as zero. 
* Some *code-segment* (**CS**) *descriptor content* (the base address and limit fields) is ignored
* The remaining fields function normally (except for the readable bit in the type field)

## L bit of Code Segment Descriptor
* Each **code segment descriptor** provides an **L** bit
* This bit allows a code segment to execute 64-bit code or legacy 32-bit code by code segment.

## L Flag
* In IA-32e mode, bit 21 of the second doubleword of the *segment descriptor* indicates whether a code segment contains native 64-bit code.
	* A value of 1 indicates instructions in this code segment are executed in 64-bit mode. 
	* A value of 0 indicates the instructions in this code segment are executed in compatibility mode.

## Segment Descriptor Tables in IA-32e Mode
* In IA-32e mode, a segment descriptor table can contain up to 8192 (2^13) 8-byte descriptors. 
* An entry in the *segment descriptor table* can be 8 bytes.
* *System descriptors* are expanded to 16 bytes (occupying the space of two entries).

## Expanded System Descriptors
* Call gate descriptors
* **IDT** gate descriptors
* **LDT** and **TSS** descriptors

## Segmentation in Linux
* ***All*** Linux processes running in User Mode use the same pair of segments to address instructions and data. 
	* These segments are called **user code segment** and **user data segment**, respectively. 
* Similarly, ***all*** Linux processes running in Kernel Mode use the same pair of segments to address instructions and data
	* they are called **kernel code segment** and **kernel data segment**, respectively. 
* Under the above design, it is possible to store all segment descriptors in the **GDT**

## Linux Logic Addresses and Linear Addresses
* The linear addresses associated with such segments all start at 0 and reach the addressing limit of 2^32-1
	* This means that all processes, either in User Mode or in Kernel Mode, may use the same logical addresses.
* Another important consequence of having all segments start at 0x00000000 is that in Linux, **logical addresses** coincide with **linear addresses**
	* that is, the value of the Offset field of a logical address always coincides with the value of the corresponding linear address

## Privilege Level Change
* The **RPL** of **CS** register determine the current privilege level of a CPU
* From user mode to kernel mode:
	* Linux 2.4: when the **CS** is changed all corresponding **DS**, **SS** registers must also be changed, i.e. load **DS**, **ES** with **__KERNEL_DS**.
	* Linux 2.6 : Load **DS, ES** with **__USER_DS**

## The Linux GDT
* In uniprocessor systems there is only one GDT, while in multiprocessor systems there is **one GDT for every CPU in the system**.
* All GDTs are stored in the **per-CPU** ```gdt_page``` variable
	* while the **addresses** and **sizes** of the GDTs (used when initializing the **gdtr** registers) are stored in the **per-CPU** ```early_gdt_descr``` variable. 

## GDT Layout
* Each GDT includes
	* 21 segment descriptors
	* and
	* 11 null, unused, or reserved entries. 
* Unused entries are inserted on purpose
	* ... so that Segment Descriptors usually accessed together are kept in the same 32-byte line of the hardware cache.

## Data Structure of a GDT Entry

## Task State Segment
* In Linux, each **processor** has only one **TSS** 
* The virtual address space corresponding to each **TSS** is a small subset of the liner address space corresponding to the **kernel data segment**
* All the TSSs are sequentially stored in the **per-CPU** ```init_tss``` variable

## Task State Segment  Descriptor
* The **TSS** descriptor for the n-th CPU
	* The Base field: point to the n-th component of the **per-CPU** ```init_tss`` variable.
	* **G** flag: 0
	* Limit field: the size of the **TSS**
	* **DPL**: 0

## Initialize the Content of TSS Descriptor

## Thread-Local Storage (TLS) Segments
* Three Thread-Local Storage (TLS) segments
	* this is a mechanism that allows **multithreaded applications** to make use of up to three segments containing data local to each **thread**
* The ```set_thread_area( )``` and ```get_thread_area( )``` system calls, respectively, create and release a TLS segment for the executing process.

## Other Special Segments
* Three segments related to Advanced Power Management (**APM**).
* Five segments related to Plug and Play **(PnP) BIOS services**. 
* A special TSS segment used by the kernel to handle "Double fault " ***exceptions***.

## GDTs of Different CPUs
* There is a copy of the GDT for each processor in the system. 
* All copies of the GDT store identical entries, except for a few cases: 
	* each processor has its own TSS segment, thus the corresponding GDT's entries differ.
	* a few entries in the GDT may depend on the process that the CPU is executing (LDT and TLS Segment Descriptors). 
	* in some cases a processor may temporarily modify an entry in its copy of the GDT
		* this happens, for instance, when invoking an APM's BIOS procedure.

## Default Local Descriptor Table (**LDT**)
* After Linux 2.6.18, there is no default LDT that is shared by ALL processes
