## **initial_page_table** and **swapper_pg_dir**
* After be initialized, the content of **swapper_pg_dir** will be copied into **initial_page_table**. 
But cr3 continuously points to **swapper_pg_dir**.

## Fix-Mapped Linear Addresses vs. Physical Addresses

## Data Structure **enum fixed_addresses**

## How to Obtain the Linear Address Set of a Fix-Mapped Linear Address
* Fix-mapped linear addresses are placed at the end of the fourth gigabyte of linear addresses.
* The **fix_to_virt( )** function computes the constant linear address starting from the index

## Associate a Physical Address with a Fix-mapped Linear Address
* Macros: **set_fixmap(idx,phys)** and **set_fixmap_nocache(idx,phys)**
	* Both functions initialize the Page Table entry corresponding to the **fix_to_virt(idx)** linear address with the physical address **phys**
	* owever, the second function also sets the **PCD** flag of the Page Table entry, 
thus disabling the hardware cache when accessing the data in the page frame.

## Process
## Definition 
* A ***process*** is usually defined as 
	* an instance of a program in execution
* Hence, you might think of a process as the ***collection of data structures** 
that fully describes now far the execution of the program has progressed.
* From the kernel's point of view, 
the purpose of a process is to act as an entity to which system resources (CPU time, memory, etc.) are allocated.

## Synonym of Processes
* Processes are often called **tasks** 
or **threads** in the Linux source code.

## Lifecycle of a Process
* Processes are like human beings
* A small difference is that sex is not really common among processes — each process has just one parent.

## Child Process’s Heritage from Its Parent Process
* When a process is created
	* it is almost identical to its parent
	* it receives a (logical) copy of the parent's address space
	* it executes the same code as the parent
* Although the parent and child may share the pages containing the program code (text), 
they have separate copies of the data (stack and heap) 
	* so that changes by the child to a memory location are invisible to the parent (and vice versa)

## Lightweight Processes and Multithreaded Application
* Linux uses ***lightweight processes*** to offer better support for ***multithreaded applications***. 
* Basically, two lightweight processes may ***share*** some resources, 
like the address space, the open files, and so on.
	* Whenever one of them modifies a shared resource, the other immediately sees the change. 
	* Of course, the two processes must synchronize themselves when accessing the shared resource.
