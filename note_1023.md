# Problems
1. 為什麼page的level要這麼多，增加level不是會增加memory access的次數嗎
	* 有 TLB 可以當 page table 的 cache
2. io port對應到的physical address還會有physical memory對應到嗎？會的話，不就有記憶體沒辦法被使用;不會的話，memory所對應到的physical address就會不連續嗎？

3. 5-1提到的vmlinux size，如果因為某些原因超過7MB的話，會發生什麼事？
	* 在給更多(e.g. 24MB)
4. CPU的ring0和ring1 ring2能執行的指令差在哪裡?
	* 目前linux和windows都沒有用到

## Kernel Page Tables
* The kernel maintains a set of page tables for its own use.
* This set of page tables is rooted at a so-called master kernel Page Global Directory.
	* After system initialization, the set of page tables are never directly used by any process or kernel thread.
	* Rather, the highest entries of the master kernel Page Global Directory are the reference model for the corresponding entries of the Page Global Directories of EVERY regular process in the system.

## How Kernel Initializes Its Own page tables
* A two-phase activity:
	* In the first phase, the kernel creates a limited address space including
	* This minimal address space is just large enough to install the kernel in RAM and to initialize its core data structures.
	* In the second phase, the kernel takes advantage of all of the existing RAM and sets up the page tables properly.

## Phase One

## The special Dot Symbol

## **initial_page_table** and **__brk_base**
* The provisional Page Global Directory is contained in the **initial_page_table** variable. 
* The provisional Page Tables are stored starting from **__brk_base**.

## Assumption
* CPU architecture is x86_32.
* **vmlinux** size is 7MB.
* boot loader put linux kernel at physical address **0x01000000**.

## Phase One Mapping Size
* In order to map 24 MB of RAM, 6 ***Page Tables*** are required.
* 16 MB (reserved memory) 
                  + 
    7 MB (vmlinux size) 
                  + 
    1 MB (MAPPING_BEYOND_END)

## MAPPING_BEYOND_END 
* Beside mapping the **vmlinux**, linux kernel will map additional memory for *bootmem allocator*. 
* In x86_32 with PAE disable, 
the value of **MAPPING_BEYOND_END** is 1MB.
* bootmem allocator:
	* When a system is initialized, there is no buddy system and slab allocator; hence, bootmem allocator is responsible for memory management and memory allocation.

## **initial_page_table** in Phase One
* The objective of this first phase of paging is to allow these 24 MB of RAM to be easily addressed both in **protected mode** before and after paging is enabled.
* Therefore, the kernel must create a mapping from both 
	* the linear addresses **0x00000000** through **0x017fffff**
	* the linear addresses **0xc0000000** through **0xc17fffff**
	* the physical addresses **0x00000000** through **0x017fffff**
* In other words, the kernel during its first phase of initialization can address the first 24 MB of RAM by
	* either linear addresses identical to the physical ones
	* or
	* 24 MB worth of linear addresses, starting from **0xc0000000**.

## Mapping Linear Addresses to Physical Addresses in Phase One (1)

## Mapping Linear Addresses to Physical Addresses in Phase One (2)

## Contents of **initial_page_table** in Phase One
* The Kernel creates the desired mapping by filling all the **initial_page_table** entries with zeroes, 
except for entries 0 ~ 5, 0x300 (decimal 768) ~ 0x305 (decimal 773); 
the latter six entries span all linear addresses between **0xc0000000** and **0xc17fffff**.
* The 0 ~ 5, 0x300 ~ 0x305 entries are initialized as follows:
	* The address field of entries 0 and 0x300 is set to the physical address of **__brk_base**

## Enable the Paging Unit
* The **startup_32( )** assembly language function also enables the *paging unit*. 
* This is achieved by loading the physical address of **initial_page_table** into the **cr3** control register and by setting the **PG** flag of the **cr0** control register

## Initial Page Global Directories

## Phase 2

## Change Page Global Directory
* **setup_arch()**
