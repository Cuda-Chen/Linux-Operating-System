# Some Problems mentioned in class
1. 最近看到新聞說有UEFI rootkit被開採 UEFI rootkit有辦法繞過OS做壞事嗎 那是不是中國的筆電都不能買了 <br>
Ans. LoJax 主要利用 RWEverything 內建核心驅動程式 RwDrv.sys 讀取 UEFI 相關設定，
驅動程式經過合法的簽署手續，因此不會引起作業系統的注意。
LoJax 接著利用 3 個不同的工具達成目標，首先掃描低階系統設定，以便根據設定擬定入侵策略，依據不同平台選擇不同的方式跳過非法韌體寫入防護機制；
接著把 UEFI 韌體檔案讀取出來，最後 1 個工具插入惡意 UEFI 模組至韌體當中並寫回。 RWEverything 是一個 windows hardware read/write tool

# Some Supplement
* base address位置破碎是為了往前相容

## Signal Notification
* Asynchronous notifications
* Synchronous notifications

## Processes' Responses to Singals
* Ignore
* Asynchronously execute a **signal handler**
	* Signal **SIGKILL** and **SIGSTOP** cannot
be directly handled by a process or ignored.

## Kernel Default Actions to Signals
* Terminate the process.
* Core dump and terminate the process
* Ignore
* Suspend
* Resume, if it was stopped.

## Process Management-related System Calls
* ```fork()```
* ```_exit()```
* ```exec()```

## system Call ```wait4()```
* The system call handler extracts data about resource usage from the **process descriptor fields**.
* The process descriptor may be released once the data is collected. 
* If no child process has already terminated when the ```wait4( )``` system call is executed, 
the kernel usually puts the process in a wait state until a child terminates.

## Process ```init```
* ```init``` is a special system process which is created during system initialization
* If a parent process terminates before its child process(es) does (do), 
then ```init``` becomes the parent process of all those child process(es).
* The ```init``` process
	* monitors the execution of all its children
	* and
	* routinely issues ```wait4( )``` system calls, whose side effect is to get rid of all orphaned zombies.

## Logical Address
* Used in machine language instructions to specify the address of an __instruction__ or an __operand__.
* A logical address <- ***segment base address*** + ***offset***
	* offset: the distance from the start of the segment to the actual address
	* In an assembly language instruction, 
the ***segment base address*** part is stored in a ***segment register*** and is usually omitted, 
because most segments are specified by default segment registers

## Linear Address (Virtual Address)
* In a IA-32 architecture, it is a unsigned 32-bit integer

## Physical Address
* Used to address memory cells in memory chips.
* Signals appear on the address bus and **CPU**’s address pins.

## Memory Address Used in a Program – Logical Addresses
* Programs use a memory address to access the content of a memory cell.
* The address used by physical memory is different from the address used in a program, 
even though both are **32**-bit unsigned integers.

## Address Transformation
* Segmentation Unit
	* A hardware circuit
	* Transform a logical address into a virtual address.
* Paging Unit
	* A hardware circuit
	* Transform a virtual address into a physical address.
* **GRAPH**

## Memory Arbitrator
* When multiple processors could access the same memory chips, 
a memory arbitrator guarantees that at any instance only one processor could access a chip.
	* A multiprocessor system
	* **DMA**
* Resides between
	* the address bus
	* and
	* memory chip

## **CPU** mode
* Starting from **80386, IA-32** provides two logical address translation method.
	* real mode
		* Compatibility with older processors
		* bootstrap
	* protected mode
		* ***In this chapter we only discuss this mode.***

## Segmentation Unit
* A logical address is decided by
	* a **16**-bit **segment selector** (segment identifier)
	* and
	* a **32**-bit **offset** within the segment identified by the segment selector.

## Segment Registers
* An **IA**-32 processor has 6 segment registers (**cs, ss, ds, es, fs, gs**)
* Each segment register holds a segment selector.
	* **cs**: points to a code segment
	* **ss**: points to a stack segment
	* **ds**: points to a data segment
	* **es, fs**, and **gs**: general purpose segment register may point to arbitrary ***data segments***.

## CPU Privilege Levels
* The **cs** register includes a 2-bit field that specifies the **Current Privilege Level** (CPL) of the **CPU**. 
	* The value 0 denotes the highest privilege level, while the value 3 denotes the lowest one. 
* Linux uses only levels 0 and 3, which are respectively called **Kernel Mode** and **User Mode**

## Segment Descriptors 
* The addresses used by a program are divided into several different areas (segments).
* Items used by a program with similar properties are saved in the same segment. 
* Each segment is represented by an **8**-byte ***Segment Descriptor*** that describes the segment characteristics.

## **GDT** vs. **LDT**
* Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
* Local Descriptor Table (LDT)
* Usually only one GDT is defined.
* While each process is permitted to have its own **LDT** if it needs to create additional segments besides those stored in the **GDT**.

## **gdtr** and **ldtr**
* both are CPU register
* gdtr
	* contains the address of **GDT** in **main memory**
* ldtr 
	* contains the address of **LDT** of the currently used **LDT**

## Frequently Used Segment Descriptor Types
* Code Segment Descriptor.
* Data Segment Descriptor.
	* P.S.: Stack Segments are implemented by means of Data Segment Descriptors.
* ***Task State Segment Descriptor*** (TSSD)
	* A TSSD describes a ***Task State Segment*** (TSS) which is used to store the contents of a process registers.
* Local Descriptor Table Descriptor (**LDTD**)

## Segment Registers
* Each segment register contains a **segment selector**.
* Associated with each **segment register** is an additional **nonprogrammable register** which contain the **segment descriptor** specified by the **segment selector**.

## DPL (Decriptior Privilege Level)
* **2**-bit field of a segment descriptor used to restrict access to the segment.
* It represents the minimal **CPU** privilege level requested for accessing the segment.

## Locate the Segment Descriptor Indicated by Segment Selector
* address = (gdtr / ldtr) + index * 8
* The first entry of the **GDT** is always 0.
* The maximum number of segment descriptors that the **GDT** can have is 2^13-1.
