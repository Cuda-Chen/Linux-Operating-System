# Problems
1. 如果 Page Directory 在Process之間不能共用的話，那是不是最多也只能有1024個Process被同時run? <br>
2. 第15頁的page table是不是要是大寫的嗎？
3. RPL做什麼 <br>
	Ans. CPL 大於等於某個東西才能作轉換

## Translation Table Types
* Page Directory
	* Each process has only ONE page directory table.
* Page Table
* Both of the above tables are located in main memory.
* Are initialized by kernel, before paging mechanisom is activated.

## Translation Table Allocation
* Each active process must have a *Page Directory* assigned to it.
* Allocating page frames to a *page table* occurs only when the process needs to access it.

## Paging of 80x86 -- The **Directory** Field
* The **Directory** field within the virtual address determines the entry in the ***Page Directory*** that points to the proper **page table**.
* The **offset** field determines the relative position within the page frame.

## *Why Use a Two-Level Scheme ?*
* Reduce the amount of **RAM** required for per-process ***page tables***.

## Structures of ***Page Directories*** And ***Page Tables*** Entries
* Both ***Page Directory*** entries and ***Page Tables*** have the same structure.

## Entry Fields (1)
* **Present** flag
* **20**-bit physical address field

## Entry Fields (2)
* **Accessed** flag
* **Dirty** flag
* The paging unit never resets the above two flags; this must be done by the operating system.

## Entry Fields (3)
* **Read/Write** flag
* **User/Supervisor** flag

## Entry Fields (4)
* **PCD** and **PWT** flags
* **Page Size** flag
* **Global** flag

## *Extended Paging*

## *Why Extended Paging Is Introduced ?*
* Introduced starting from the ***Pentium*** model.
* Allows page frames to be **4 MB** instead of 4 KB in size.
* Extended paging is used to translate __large contiguous linear address ranges__ into __corresponding physical ones__.
* In these cases, the kernel can do without intermediate ***Page Tables*** and thus save memory and preserve **TLB** entries.

## Enable Extended Paging
* Is enabled by
	* setting the **Page Size** flag of a ***Page Directory*** entry. 
	* setting the **PSE** flag of the **cr4** processor register.

## Virtual Address Layout under Extended Paging
* Under extended paging, the paging unit divides the 32 bits of a linear address into two fields:
	* **Directory** (10 bits)
	* **Offset** (22 bits; P.S.: 2^22=4**MB**)

## New Futures of Page Directory Entries under Extended Paging
* Under extended paging, the structure of a ***Page Directory*** and the entries inside it are the same as those in regular paging, except:
	* The **Page** Size flag is set.
	* Only the **10** most significant bits of the **20**-bit physical address field are significant.

## Privilege Levels
* The ***segmentation unit*** uses four possible privilege levels to protect a __segment__ (the two-bit request privilege levels, 0 for kernel mode, 3 for user mode).
* The ***paging unit*** uses a different strategy to protect __***Page Tables*** and page frames__ --> the User/Supervisor flag.
	* **0  CPU**’s **CPL** must be less than 3 (i.e. for Linux, when the processor is in kernel mode.)
	* **1**  the corresponding ***Page Table*** or page frame can always be accessed.

## The Physical Address Extension (**PAE**) Paging Mechanism 

## Physical Address Extension (**PAE**) Paging Mechanism (1)
* Starting with the ***Pentium Pro***, all Intel processors have 36 address lines; therefore, they are now able to address 2^36=64**GB** of **RAM** when is in **PAE** mode.
* **PAE** is activated by setting the **Physical Address Extension (PAE)** flag in the **cr4** control register.
* Question: CPU registers such as **EIP, ESP**, are still 32 bits; thus, how to transfer a 32-bit virtual address into a 36-bit physical one?
	* Answer: Introduce a new paging mechanism.
Physical Address Extension (**PAE**) Paging Mechanism (2)
* The 64 GB (= 2^24x2^12) of **RAM** are split into 2^24  4-**KB** page frames.
* The entry size of ***Page Directories*** or ***Page Tables*** is increased from 4 bytes to **8** bytes; 
thus, each 4-**KB** page frame contains **512** (=2^9) entries instead of 1024 entries.
* The address field of each ***page table entry*** is increased form **20** bits to **24** bits; 
therefore, the address field can point to any of the 2^24  4-**KB** page frames.
* A new level of **page table** is introduced --- the ***Page Directory Pointer Table*** (**PDPT**) 

## Physical Address Extension (**PAE**) Paging Mechanism (3)
* Each **PDPT** entry is 8 byte long.
* The **PDPT** has only 4 entries.
* The base address of a **PDPT** is store in **cr3** control register.
* The **PDPT** is located in the first 4 **GB** of **RAM** (i.e. the 4 most significant bits are 0) and aligned to 32 bytes (2^5); 
therefore, the **cr3** only needs 27 bits to point a **PDPT** (4+27+5=36.) 

## Physical Address Extension (**PAE**) Paging Mechanism (4)
* When **PAE** is activated, and the **PS** flag in ***Page Directory*** is cleared (i.e. each page frame is 4**KB**), 
a virtual address is split into the following four fields **PDPT**(2 bits), **PD**(9 bits), **PT**(9 bits), **Offset**(12 bits).

## Physical Address Extension (**PAE**) Paging Mechanism (5)
* When **PAE** is activated, and the **PS** flag in ***Page Directory*** is set (i.e. each page frame is 2MB(=2^21), 
a virtual address is split into the following three fields **PDPT**(2 bits), **PD**(9 bits), **Offset**(21 bits).

## Physical Address Extension (**PAE**) Paging Mechanism (6)
* The contribution of the **PAE** paging mechanism
* Question: When internal registers’ size is only 32 bits, how could a process address more than 4GB Physical addresses?

## Paging for 64-bit Architectures 
* All hardware paging systems for 64-bit processors make use of additional paging levels. 
* The number of levels used depends on the type of processor.
