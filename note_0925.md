# Problems on class
1. Linux 可以把kernel address space改成2G嗎？<br>
	Ans. Yes, but the segment should always larger than 4K.
2. 根據mode能不能執行某些指令是cpu決定的嗎 mode是kernel 設定的？如何設定呢？<br>
	Ans. (1) 現在的權限=現在eip所在段選擇子的DPL 如果你要進去的段的DPL權限比現在你的DPL高就不能執行 <br>
	(2) 要用gate類型的方法跳進去kernel mode
2.1 所以權限是 kernel 在看嗎？ gate 類型是啥 <br>
	Ans. 是cpu看 高權限的code放在高權限的選擇子 usermode的選擇子都是低權限 當你要進kernel mode的時候 cpu檢查發現你要把dpl低的 改到dpl高的 就會被擋下來 <br>
	gate是一系列cpu有的東西 工作門 中斷門 之類的 可以透過這個破例跳進高權限的段
3. 請問kernel mode可不可以access其他process的user address space <br>
	Ans. Yes, e.g. debugger
	理論上都在 kernel mode 了當然是可以 access user process 內的資料, 但是新的 CPU 有 SMAP 可以阻止這件事發生

## Operating System Objectives
* A user program can not directly operate on a hardware.
* Provide an execution environment to the applications that run on the computer system (the so-called *user programs*).

## Address Space
* A set of addresses.
	* most mentioned in this lecture
* or
* The union of the memory cells whose addresses and address space.

## Address Space of A Process
* Total 4 Giga bytes.
* the first 3 Giga bytes (0x00000000 ~ 0xBFFFFFFF) -> **user address space**
* the fourth Giga bytes (0xC0000000 ~ 0xFFFFFFFF) -> **kernel address space**

## Linux Memory Layout (64-bit)
* support up to 48-bit virtual addresses(256TB = 2^48)

## Canonical Form Addresses
* The AMD specification requires that bits 48 through 63 of any virtual address 
must be copies of bit 47 (in a manner akin to sign extension)
, or the processor will raise an exception.

## Two Address Ranges
* 0x ~ 0x00007FFF'FFFFFFFF
* and
* 0xFFFF8000'00000000 ~ 0xFFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF

## Current 48-bit Implementation

## Execution Modes vs. Address Space – (3) 
* The contents of the user address space of different processes maybe are different
; however, the contents of all processes’ kernel address space are the same.

## Mode Switch
* system call

## Kernel Threads
* Always run in kernel mode in the kernel address space.
* Not interact with users.
* Not require terminal devices, such as monitors and keyboard.
* Usually are created during system startup and killed when the system is shut down.

## Interrupt vs. Exception
* **Interrupt** -- Asynchronous
* **Exception** -- Synchronous (on behalf of the process that causes the exception)
	* Divided by zero
	* Page fault
	* Invalid **OP** or address

## Process Descriptor
* Inside the kernel, each process is represented by a process descriptor.
* Each process descriptor consists of two parts.
	* The process-related data
	* The process’s kernel-level stack.

## Interrupt
* The interrupt handler and interrupt service routine use current process’s kernel stack as their own stack
.

## Kernel Control Path
* The sequence of instructions executed by the kernel to handle
	* a system call, 
	* an exception,
	* or
	* an interrupt.

## Sharing Process Address Space
* Reduce memory usage
* Explicitly requested by processes
* mmap() system call allows part of **a file** or **the memory residing on a device** to be mapped into a part of a process address space.

## Signals
* Linux uses signals to notify processes system events.
* Each event has its own signal number, which is usually referred to by a symbolic constant such as SIGTERM.
